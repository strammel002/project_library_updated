# Project 1: Triple Peaks Library

The Triple Peaks Library webpage is the first project in the Software Engineering
program at TripleTen. It was created using HTML and CSS, based on a design brief.

Since learning more about CSS and the BEM Flat file structure I decide to refactor the css files in
this project.

I plan on using some elements of this project in my first solo project: The Vestals: An Open Source Gallery.
I also plan on improving upon this landing page as I learn more at Tripleten.

## Project features

- Semantic HTML5
- Flexbox
- Positioning
- Vertical stacking with z-index
